## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
percentage_change = abs((yesterdays_price - two_days_ago_price) / two_days_ago_price) * 100

if percentage_change >= 5:
    print("Get News")

# percentage_change = 6

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

the_news = news_response.json()
first3vals = the_news['articles'][:3]


# if percentage_change >=5:
#     print(first3vals["articles"])

#print(first3vals)

        for article in first3vals:
            print(f"{STOCK}: ðŸ”º{percentage_change}%\nHeadline: {article["title"]}\nBrief: {article["description"]}")

        for article in first3vals:
            print(f"{STOCK}: ðŸ”º{percentage_change}%\nHeadline: {article["title"]}\nBrief: {article["description"]}")


## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#Twilio integration is broken. Can't do this step. However, if we could, the printed output would suffice as challenge completion.

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
